## Simulating Data in DeclareDesign

```{r}
set.seed(303)
library(DeclareDesign)
N <- 10000


# An unnamed, standard normal variable:
univariate_pop <- declare_population(
  declare_variable(),
  size = N
)
univariate_draw <- draw_population(population = univariate_pop)
head(univariate_draw)


# Multinomial, binomial and normal covariates
multivariate_pop <- declare_population(
  income = declare_variable(type = "normal",
                            location_scale = c(mean = 1000, sd = 10)),
  gender = declare_variable(type = "gender"),
  party = declare_variable(type = "us_party"),
  employed = declare_variable(type = "binary"),
  size = N
)
multivariate_draw <- draw_population(population = multivariate_pop)
head(multivariate_draw)
```

## Multilevel covariate Structures
```{r}
N_per_level <- c(people = 100,
                 villages = 5)

# Note: level names are inhereted from the variable declarations, not 
# from the the N_per_level vector

villagers <- declare_population(
 person = list(
   gender =  declare_variable(type = "binary"), # 1 or 0, obviously
   income = declare_variable(
    type = "normal",
    location_scale = c(normal_mean = 10,normal_sd = 5)) #want some positive income, normally distributed
 ),
 village = list(
   N_people_raw = declare_variable(type = "normal",location_scale = c(20,1)),
   N_people = "round(N_people_raw,0)",
   poor_area = declare_variable(type = "binary")
 ),
 size = N_per_level
)

people_draw <- draw_population(population = villagers)
head(people_draw)
```

## Sampling


```{r}
#install.packages("sampling")
library(sampling)
```

## Simple Random Sampling  
* Simplest sample design
* Each element has an equal probability of being selected from a list of all population units (sample of n from N population).   

**2 Types of SRS**:   

* SRS with replacement (SRSWR): probability of selection of an element remains unchanged   
```{r}
#srswr(n,N), where n is sample size, N is population size
Inc=people_draw$income
person=people_draw$person_ID
n=20
hist(Inc)
# Conduct SRS with replacement
s=srswr(n,length(Inc))
#with the number of replicates
as.vector(person[s==1])
s[s!=0]
hist(Inc[s==1])
```

* SRS without replacement (SRSWOR)   

```{r}
#srswor(n,N), where n is sample size, N is population size
Inc=people_draw$income
person=people_draw$person_ID
n=20
# Select a sample
s=srswor(n,length(Inc))
#The sample is
as.vector(person[s==1])
hist(Inc[s==1])
```


**Cons of SRS**:  
1. Lack of listing frame: the method requires that a list of population elements be available, which is not the case for many populations.  
2. Problem of small area estimation or domain analysis: For a small sample from a large population, all the areas may not have enough sample size for making small area estimation or for domain analysis by variables of interest.  
3. Not cost effective: SRS requires covering of whole population which may reside in a large geographic area; interviewing few samples spread sparsely over a large area would be very costly.

**Pros of Systematic Sampling**  
1. Provides a better random distribution than SRS  
2. Simple to implement  
3. May be started without a complete listing frame (say,interview of every 9th patient coming to a clinic).  
4. With ordered list, the variance may be smaller than SRS (see below for exceptions) 
**Cons of SS**
- Periodicity (cyclic variation)  
- linear trend  

## Cluster Sampling:

**Advantages**:
- Generating sampling frame for clusters is economical, and sampling
frame is often readily available at cluster level
- Most economical form of sampling
- Larger sample for a similar fixed cost
- Less time for listing and implementation
- Also suitable for survey of institutions

**Disadvantages**:
- May not reflect the diversity of the community.   
- Other elements in the same cluster may share similar characteristics.   
- Provides less information per observation than an SRS of the same size (redundant information: similar information from the others in the cluster).   
- Standard errors of the estimates are high, compared to other sampling designs with same sample size  

**Key Terms**:
** Primary sampling units (PSU)**: clusters  
** Secondary sampling units (SSU)**: households/individual elements   
** Simple one-stage cluster sample**:  

List all the clusters in the population, and from the list, select the clusters ???
usually with simple random sampling (SRS) strategy. All units (elements)
in the sampled clusters are selected for the survey.  

**Simple two-stage cluster sample**:   

List all the clusters in the population.   
First select the clusters, usually by simple random sampling (SRS).The units (elements) in the selected clusters of the first-stage are then sampled in the second-stage, usually by simple random sampling (or often by systematic sampling). 

```{r}
#cluster(data, clustername, size, method=c("srswor","srswr","poisson",
#"systematic"),pik,description=FALSE)

#Select a sample of 3 villages, sampling without replacement
cl=cluster(people_draw,clustername=c("village_ID"),size=3,method="srswor")
dat1<-getdata(people_draw, cl)
head(dat1)

#Select a sample of 3 villages, systematic sampling
# the pik vector is randomly generated using the U(0,1) distribution
cl_sys=cluster(people_draw,clustername=c("village_ID"),size=3,method="systematic",
pik=runif(7))
# extracts the observed data
dat<-getdata(people_draw,cl_sys)
head(dat)
```

## Stratified Sampling
**When?**  
- Population groups may have different values for the responses of interest.  
- If we want to improve our estimation for each group separately.  
- To ensure adequate sample size for each group.  
**Stratified Sampling means**:  
- stratum variables are mutually exclusive (non-over lapping), e.g., urban/rural areas, economic categories, geographic regions,race, sex, etc.  
- the population (elements) should be homogenous within-stratum, and  
- the population (elements) should be heterogenous between the strata.  

**Pros**:
1. Provides opportunity to study the stratum variations - estimation could be made for
each stratum  
2. Disproportionate sample may be selected from each stratum  
3. The precision likely to increase as variance may be smaller than SRS with same sample size  
4. Field works can be organized using the strata (e.g., by geographical areas or regions)  
5. Reduce survey costs  

** Cons**:  
- Sampling frame is needed for each stratum  
- Analysis method is complex (Correct variance estimation)  
- Data analysis should take sampling ???weight??? into account for disproportionate sampling of strata   
- Sample size estimation is difficult in practice    

**For Stratified Sampling**:  
- Variance estimated under stratified sampling is always lower than the variance estimated under SRS.  
- Strata totals are additive. But, not the strata means!  
- A minimum of two-elements must be chosen from each stratum so that sampling errors can be estimated for all strata independently.  
- The population (elements) should be homogenous within stratum, and the population (elements) should be heterogenous between the strata.  

**Stratified sampling of villages in poor and rich areas**   

```{r}
#strata(data, stratanames=NULL, size, method=c("srswor","srswr","poisson",
#"systematic"), pik,description=FALSE)
# the variable "poor_area" has 2 categories ('0' and '1'). 
# the variable "village_ID" has 5 categories (1, 2, 3,4,5).
# computes the population stratum sizes
table(people_draw$poor_area,people_draw$village_ID)
# there are 5 cells with non-zero values
# one draws 5 samples (1 sample in each stratum)
# the sample stratum sizes are 10,9,11,12,12, respectively
# the method is 'srswor' (equal probability, without replacement)
s=strata(people_draw,c("poor_area","village_ID"),size=c(10,9,11,12,12), method="srswor")
# extracts the observed data
a<-getdata(people_draw,s)
head(a)
# see the result using a contigency table
table(s$poor_area,s$village_ID)
```

**Stratified sampling by village_ID and individual-level covariate (gender)**
```{r}
# compute the population stratum sizes:
table(people_draw$village_ID,people_draw$gender)
# there are 10 cells with non-zero values
# one draws 10 samples (1 sample in each stratum)
# the sample stratum sizes are 5,6,7,4,5,8,5,4,4,5,6,2 respectively
s=strata(people_draw,c("village_ID","gender"),size=c(5,6,7,4,5,8,5,4,4,5,6,2), method="systematic",pik=people_draw$income) ## the selection probabilities are computed using the variable 'income'
b<-getdata(people_draw,s)
head(b)
table(s$village_ID,s$gender)
```

## 3.Sampling of geographical units (GIS in R)


```{r}
#library(pacman)
#p_load(ggmap,rgdal,rgeos,maptools,dplyr,tidyr,tmap)
```

**1. Getting the Data**
Go here: [https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R]  
Download as a ZIP or through cloning, unpack into the folder you're working in.   Create a new .Rpoj or open Creating-maps-in-R.Rproj 

Now I will move to Creating-maps-in-R.Rproj in my GitHub, Seminar 5.
